# VietnamStockMarket


## Introduction

The past few years, investing (or trading) in Vietnam is a trendy topic. In the Covid-19 pandemic, people can not 
go out for work, therefore they have to find another way to make money online and at home. Therefore, investing is one
of many ways to achieve that purpose. 

With the passion of the stock market and programming, I have created these notebooks to perform some basic tasks such as:
data collection, visualization, and analysis for single stock and portfolio. 

These notebooks leverage other wonderful projects such as [vnquant](https://github.com/phamdinhkhanh/vnquant), 
[investpy](https://investpy.readthedocs.io), [backtesting.py](https://kernc.github.io/backtesting.py/), etc. Although there
are a lot of bugs and not-well-written codes in this project, I still believe in providing new insights about 
algorithmic trading for those who are new and interested in it. If you guys see places for improvement, please feel free to 
contact me.
